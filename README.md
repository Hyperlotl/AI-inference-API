# AI inference API
This is a scratch extension that allows you to connect to AI inference providers (eg cerebras) to generate messages. Perfect for chatbots, role-play and the like!
So yeah... its just my turbo-chatbot extension but like, a thousand times better
# Basics:
Refer to this image for the most basic setup (uses JSON extension)

Note: you can get your API key from API.cerebras.ai. As a precaution, you SHOULD encrypt this key when publishing it



the system message is what tells the AI how to act(i.e y"You are Homer Simpson")
