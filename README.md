# AI inference API
This is a scratch extension that allows you to connect to AI inference providers (eg cerebras) to generate messages. Perfect for chatbots, role-play and the like!

So yeah... its just my turbo-chatbot extension but like, a thousand times better

To install, just copy extension.js and paste it into Turbowarp's custom extension area. MAKE SURE  'RUN EXTENSION AS UNSANDBOXED' is on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# Basics:

Note: you can get your API key from https://cloud.cerebras.ai/ As a precaution, you SHOULD encrypt this key when publishing it

the system message is what tells the AI how to act(i.e y"You are Homer Simpson")
